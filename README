Mutating OWLs: a tool for ontology mutation testing

This software generates mutants on ontologies defined in the OWL
language. The syntax used for OWL is generally not relevant; however,
due to some limitations in support libraries, if the ontology uses
imports, then the imported ontologies must be saved in an XML format
(either RDF/XML or OWL/XML). Without imports, the software is able to
parse the ontologies regardless of the syntax in which they are
formatted.

To use the software, a standard installation of Eclipse 4.5 (Mars)
running on Java version 1.8 is sufficient. Alternatively, the software
relies on a number of external libraries, but they are easily managed
using Apache Maven.

The tool is currently in alpha stage, and does not offer a graphical
interface or expose APIs. It has not been developed as an Eclipse
plug-in.

The main method is located in the following class:

lu.uni.owl.mutatingowls.MutatingOWLs

The input ontology is fed to the software via an argument to the main
method. The input must be specified as a full file name with
extension. In case no ontology is specified, the tool currently falls
back to a default ontology. At the current development stage, the
ontology must be stored in a subdirectory of the project directory,
called resources; however, ontologies imported by the input ontology
can be stored in the same folder, in subfolders, or on the web.
